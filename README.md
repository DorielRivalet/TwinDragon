### Hi! I'm TwinDragon, aka. TwinShadow!

Some quick notes about me and what I do, because I'm not much of a coder. lol...

First, my name is Ryan, and I can understand a tiny bit of code, but I could never write something from scratch. I used to do basic HTML/CSS stuff back in the day, but now I don't and stick to more practical skills. Below, you'll find a more detail list of my interests.
